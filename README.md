# OpenMention.com-patterns-for-WordPress
A collection of simple plugins that add patterns for WebMention for use with OpenTopic sites like [OpenMentions.com](https://openmentions.com).

## How to use
Grab the plugin files you fancy using, upload to plugins directory and activate. Your patterns should be ready to use.

## Why though?
TBH, these are little more than paragraphs with a hyperlink. That is because (1) WebMention is that simple, and (2) I wanted an easier way to add OpenMentions tags on my blogs.

## What is Open Mentions?
Open Mentions is a project (and website) I started with open topics for anyone to WebMention. Thus, it acts like a bit of content discovery.

## So, what is OpenTopic then?
The generic version, because why should my website be the only open WebMention target?

## What do I need to use to use Open Mentions?
Anything that lets you publish text on the web with a link. 

You can manually ping most WebMention targets. OpenMention is no exception - copy the post URL, click the link, use the ping form.

A far better way is to just use the [WebMention plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/).

## What have you got?

* Health - tags about health
* WordPress Dev - tags for blogging about WordPress Dev
* Blogging topics - prompts and questions for journaling and blogging (various sites)
* DreamLog - for logging your dreams
* Writers - a whole bunch of open topics writers might like to use
